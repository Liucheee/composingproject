- Working in terms of high level functions are crucial in order to act as a higher level language
- General patterns can be made into concepts which can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as values

###1.6.1

***Functions as arguments***
- 

**Summation Example**
- The example creates the function summation which can be shared
- The "combination example" works via 2 components
- First being the summation of the values
- Second being the special transformation to the values

**Identity Example**
- The identity function can be used to return its argument
- This example highlights how additional transformations could be added in

**Direct Example**
- Function can be used directly without defining another function
- Prebuilt functions can be utilised 

**Pi Example**
- Summation can be used as a white label solution
