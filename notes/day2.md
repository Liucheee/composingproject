***1.2.1***
- 
**Expressions**
E.g. Number

***1.2.2***
- 
**Call Expression**

- A Function with some arguments 

E.g. max function maps input to single out 

- The order of arguments in a call expression matter.
This is can be seen in the example of the power to.

```
pow(100, 2)
10000
pow(2, 100)
1267650600228229401496703205376
```

- Function notation has 3 principal advantages over mathematical
convention of infix notation
- No ambiguity can arise because function name before agument
``` 
- max(min(1, -2), min(pow(3, 5), -4))
- 2
```

- No limit to depth of nesting and the overall complexity 
but it should be understandable

***1.2.3***
- 

**Importing Libary Functions**
``` 
from "libary" import "module"
```
- Import libaries to utilise already prebuilt libary 
- Import statements designates module name and then lists the specific attributes wanted


``` 
from "operator" import "function"
```
- Operator functions cna be substituted for the symbols instead 
- E.g (Add vs +)


***1.2.4***
- 
**Names and the Environment**

- Binding statements assign values 
- name must be left and value must be right 
``` 
Name = Value 
```
- names can also be bound via the import statements
- " = " symbol is assignment operator
- Abstraction allows for us to refer to the result of operations
- Environments act as the memory for interpreters to store what values were bound to what names. 
- Names can also be bound to function. 
- Successive statements can rebind that name to a new value or function 
- Variable names can be bound to different value as a result of executing a program. 
- 


``` 
- 
```

- This allows for
