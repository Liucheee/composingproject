***Defining new functions***
-

- Function definitions consists of "def" statement which has a "name"
- Afterwards a return statement, 
- 

``` 
def <name>(<formal parameters>):
    return <return expression>
```

- Second line indented (4 spaces)
- Return expression isn't evaluated right away.
- Stored as part of a newly defined function and evaluated only when it is applied


- Pre-defined functions can be used as a building block in defining other functions
- User-defined function are used the same way as the built-in functions.
