***Statements***
-

- Contains expressions as components 
- Statements are executed rather than being just evaluated
- Statements describe change while execution applies the named change
- Expressions executed as statements are evaluated but the values are discarded.
- Pure functions have no effect but non-pure function can cause effects as consequence of function application
