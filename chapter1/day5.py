def square(x):
    mul(x, x) # Watch out! This call doesn't return a value.

# The body has a expression. The function nul is called but the result isn't stored
# For this to be valid it would require a assignment statement.Originally, we stated that the body of a user-defined function consisted only of a return statement with a single return expression. In fact, functions can define a sequence of operations that extends beyond a single expression.
#
# Whenever a user-defined function is applied, the sequence of clauses in the suite of its definition is executed in a local environment â€” an environment starting with a local frame created by calling that function. A return statement redirects control: the process of function application terminates whenever the first return statement is executed, and the value of the return expression is the returned value of the function being applied.
#
# Assignment statements can appear within a function body. For instance, this function returns the absolute difference between two quantities as a percentage of the first, using a two-step calculation:

def square(x):
    return mul(x, x)

# This example returns the null function value

def print_square(x):
    print(square(x))

# Sometimes it makes sense for non-pure functions
