def square(x):
    mul(x, x) # Watch out! This call doesn't return a value.

# The body has a expression. The function nul is called but the result isn't stored
# For this to be valid it would require a assignment statement.

def square(x):
    return mul(x, x)

# This example returns the null function value

def print_square(x):
    print(square(x))

# Sometimes it makes sense for non-pure functions
